# Tutoring-Website-

The Concord Tutoring Website is a website in which users have the privilege to check the schedules through their web browser, either on their phone, tablet or laptop.

In addition to checking the schedules, users can also view the tutorsâ€™ profile, and can also request a tutoring session outside of regular tutor hours.  Tutors do not get paid to tutor outside of their regular hours, so this is up to the discretion of the tutor to respond.

Last but not least, all users must login in order to use this service.  Users will have to create their own user account to use the website. Upon visiting the website each time, users must login to access the rest of the website.


Future Plans 


Currently, the database is just user created accounts.  Ideally, I would like for Concord University to adopt this website and incorporate their user account database so that users can login with their school accounts without having to create an account.

I would eventually like to incorporate a rating system so that users can rate their experience with their tutors.

I would also like to eventually make a phone application that is even simpler and easier to use than visiting a website.
